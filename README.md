## OMDb API Key

To enable the usage of OMDb's API an API key must be provided in the environment.
This can be set using an *.env* file at the root of the project where
`REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=<APIKEY>` is included.

**NOTE:** The development server will have to be restarted in order to pick up
the updated environment variables.
